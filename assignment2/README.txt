Assignment2 has been done by Zejian Wang(zw222bb) and Katarina Simakina(es225hi).

 Each task has a package with classes.

However, if you want to compile and run the Java program in windows terminal, follow these steps:
1. Extract files from the zip folders.
2. Navigate to the Directory src where you can see all packages.

                                      java -cp . PackageName/ClassNameMain
