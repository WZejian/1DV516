The assignment 1 has been done by Zejian Wang(zw222bb) and Katarina Simakina(es225hi).

Each task has a package with two classes, expect task 4 and task 7(only has one class)
Run the main class in the package, eg. QuickFindMain in package task_1;

However if you want to compile and run the Java program in windows terminal, follow these steps:
1. Extract files from the zip folders.
2. Navigate to the Directory src where you can see all packages.
3. Use the follwing commands such as  javac -cp . PackageName/*.java
                                      java -cp . PackageName/ClassNameMain

Example, if we want to run task_4
    Steps:
    1. Navigate directory for example C:\Users\username\desktop\Assignment1
    2. write the command:  javac -cp . task_4/*.java
    3. write the command:  java -cp . task_4/task4Main
